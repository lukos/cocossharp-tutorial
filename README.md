# CocosSharp-tutorial
An introduction to using CocosSharp in Visual Studio to develop games

This will be updated into individual folders as additional code is written for each part. Although you can clone this code,
it is recommended that you try and work along and write the code yourself, to give you the experience of things not working
and trying to debug them as you go along. You can obviously look at the code written here if you get stuck!

This was written in Visual Studio 2017 with the CocosSharp templates installed and the Xamarin workload installed. Please see
the Part 1 video on the YouTube channel at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TtVR_p2CY&list=PLpNYlUeSK_rkOzDM6408IYJ8KYS82SylT>.
